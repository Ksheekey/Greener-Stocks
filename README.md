Greener stocks

Here at Greener-Stocks, our goal was to provide a comfortable place for our end users as they look at both stock specific charts and also charts that present information concerning the entire s&p 500. On page load you will find a dropwdown at the top along with other menu items that will be present throughout the web-pages. Click a stock within the dropdown to get started!

*The home page is meant to be a comfortable place 

*Our drop down menue allows for a closer look at all chart we use in the home page.

* The Tree Map shows the entire S&P 500. Green means an increase in price over the last 6 months and red shows a decrease. The larger the change the larger the squares. 

*The Word Map allows a quick view into the news connected with the stock you wish to choose. Once the Word Map is up click an interesting word and you will find articles popping up below the Word Map.
