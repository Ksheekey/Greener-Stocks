# Greener Stocks

Here at Greener-Stocks, our goal was to provide a comfortable place for our end users as they look at both stock specific charts and also charts that present information concerning the entire s&p 500. On page load you will find a dropwdown at the top along with other menu items that will be present throughout the web-pages. Click a stock within the dropdown to get started! 

(At any point you can return to the homepage by clicking the Greener-Stocks logo on the top left)

Once a stock is selected, a GIF stating whether to buy or sell will appear at the top, just for amusement. Below that you will see 5 charts. These consist of; 

A candlestick chart that tells you how its been doing for the previous 6 months, then our prediction for month 7 closing (Cmo7). 

Next to that is a prediction chart with regression from the previous 6 to make our prediction. This chart was more for our end to make our prediction but thought the user should see how we came up with our information. Month 6 (Cmo6) is the current price, so all points intersect there, then using regression we found where the month 7 (Cmo7) from each point would land. Our prediction is the average of those numbers. 

This info is ranging from December 2020 (Cmo1) to May 2021 (Cmo6) with our prediction being for June 2021 (Cmo7).

After that is a volume chart to see what happened on those 6 months(no prediction here). 

Then there are static graphs that show all the stocks together rather then just the stock chosen. The pie chart shows stocks predicted percent change from close month 6 (Cmo6) to close month 7 (Cmo7) for all stocks for the user to better see how the predicted number for stocks as a whole are broken up.

Lastly is a line graph of all stocks with their 6th month - 7th month(predicted) closing difference. The red line is an indicator for the stock chosen.

If you wanted a better/closer look at the candlestick, prediction or static graphs you can head to the 'All Charts' dropdown next to the stock selector dropdown at the top of the page. Once inside one of those, feel free to choose a stock from the main dropdown to see those graphs closer!

The next tab will bring you to the Tree Map. This tree map shows all the stocks from the last 6 months and what the overall difference was. Tooltips are present when you hover your mouse over a stock for more information. The brighter red the stock, the worse it did, while the brighter green the stock, the better it did. These are broken into sectors to see how the do compared to other similar stocks. To get a closer look at a sector click the name of the sector. To return to the full tree map, reclick the sector name!

After that is a News Word Cloud. The wordcloud allows a quick view into the news connected with the stock you wish to choose. Once the word map is up, click an interesting word and you will find real-time linked articles below that made the word cloud. 
  
The next page is our data page, this holds the data involved in our project. Feel free to scrape the information.

Lastly, the Who We Are page consists of the team responsible for the webpage!
